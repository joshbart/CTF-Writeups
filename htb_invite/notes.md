Hack The Box - Invite
=====================

This is my notes for securing an invite to Hack The Box.  They are a record of my actions taken so far and are thus unedited.

0817: I began by examining the invite page. (https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite)  It looks like some sort of responsive javascript is used to code it.  There is a simple "invite code" text box and a button that says "Sign up". (See screenshot 1)  Clicking the button causes a pop-up text field to appear in the text box that says "Please fill out this field."  I looked up a list of the most common passwords used (https://techviral.net/common-passwords-might-surprise/) and started trying them.  None of the top 25 I have tried have worked.

0831: I opened up the Firefox developer tools to be greeted by a pirate flag generated by javascript in the console tab. (See screenshot 2)

0850: I clicked on the inspector tab to examine the code and see if anything else was hiding.  There was a file there named "/js/inviteapi.min.js". I intend on examining this more.

0854: I went to the debugger tab to look further at inviteapi.min.js.  There was the following line in the script: "response|function|log|console|code|dataType|json|POST|formData|ajax|type|url|success|api|invite|error|data|var|verifyInviteCode|makeInviteCode|how|to|generate|verify".  There may be a way to manipulate this API in some way.
