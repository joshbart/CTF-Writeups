# PicoCTF - 2017

These are my notes for completing the 2017 edition of PicoCTF. They are a record of my actions taken so far and are thus unedited.

**1023**: I've already started PicoCTF, so some of these notes are catch-up notes.  I didn't think that I would need notes for this, considering the tutorial was very easy.  But, I'm finding that some of the Level 1 challenges are worth taking notes on.
