## Clue Text:
We can get into the Administrator's computer with a browser exploit. But first, we need to figure out what browser they're using.  Perhaps this information is located in a network packet capture we took: [data.pcap][data.pcap]. Enter the browser and version as "BrowserName BrowserVersion". NOTE: We're just looking for up to 3 levels of subversions for the browser version (ie. Version 1.2.3 for Version 1.2.3.4) and ignore any 0th subversions (ie. 1.2 for 1.2.0)
